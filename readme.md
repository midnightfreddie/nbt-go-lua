An attempt to expose NBT to a lua environment as a table for user scripting.

Just starting with the lua VM and will add bits and pieces.

The current code is a fork of my github.com/midnightfreddie/nbt2json repo
([v0.4.0](https://github.com/midnightfreddie/nbt2json/tree/v0.4.0)), and I'm
going to adapt the existing conversion functions to gopher-lua table structures.
